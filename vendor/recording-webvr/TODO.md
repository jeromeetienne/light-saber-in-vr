- make a pause/seek in the player
- make a keyboard stuff to move in the record, it will help the syncup
- make webvrrecorder.html and gamepadrecorder.html more homogeneous

- file are getting huge... how to do better ?
  - store only delta
  - store in binary
- LATER save in binary - should i record in json ?
  - large files => slow download + huge memory usage
  - what are the alternatives ? to save in binary
  - what about after you did json ?
  - yeah no emergency
